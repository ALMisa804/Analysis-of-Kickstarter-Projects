Analysis of Kickstarter campaigns:

2185 out of 4,114 Kickstarter campaigns (53%) were successful.  The categories of theater, music and film & video made up 77% of the successful projects while the other categories of technology, photography, publishing, games and food comprise the remaining 23%. With regards to the 1,530 failed campaigns which make up 37% of all campaigns, the categories of food, games and publishing saw the highest failure rates. Also, all of the journalism projects were cancelled.

One limitation that I see with this dataset is that the goal, pledged and average donation numbers for these projects are in all different currencies. This makes it difficult to gauge the actual monetary values involved. Converting and putting them all under one currency would make it simpler to determine the monetary values and from there you can convert over to any other currency as needed.

We can create tables and graphs comparing the number of campaigns as well as how each category and sub category did by country. We can also look at how much money was donated in each country and for which categories. This can give us insight into which projects that people in specific countries are interested in as well as the amount of money donated in these specific countries.
